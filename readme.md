# **Left-Sided Studios Official Website**

This repository contains the source code for the official Left-Sided Studios informational website. The site serves as a central hub for showcasing our core games, outlining our subsidiaries, listing our partners, and providing essential contact information.  
The website is designed as a single-page application (SPA) built using modern web standards (HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript) for speed and simplicity.

## **✨ Features**

* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for seamless viewing on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using Tailwind CSS.  
* **Single-Page Architecture:** Uses JavaScript to dynamically render content (home, games, subsidiaries, partners, contact) without full page reloads.  
* **Game and Subsidiary Details:** Dedicated pages for detailed descriptions of projects like *Cardamania*, *Bumbl*, and subsidiary studios like ANdᴱ Studios.  
* **External Links Integration:** Direct links to the official Left-Sided Studios Google Site and GameJolt pages.  
* **Lucide Icons:** Utilizes the lightweight Lucide icon library for modern, clean visuals.

## **🚀 Getting Started**

The Left-Sided Studios website is built into a single, self-contained index.html file, making local setup extremely simple.

### **Prerequisites**

You need a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.). No special server-side dependencies are required.

## **📁 Project Structure**

The entire application logic, structure, and styling are contained within one file:

| Filepath | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| index.html | The main file containing all HTML structure, JavaScript logic (routing, data storage, rendering), and CSS styling (via Tailwind CDN). |

The data for all games, subsidiaries, partners, and team members is stored directly within the \<script\> tag as a JavaScript object (db), making content management centralized.
